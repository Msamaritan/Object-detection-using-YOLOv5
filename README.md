# Object-detection-using-YOLOv5

Ultralytics have done a awesome job having developed the SOTA like YOLO, and the recent release of YOLOv5 which is based on the famous deep learning library - ### Pytorch ###
## What have I done ?
I made use of the SOTA YOLOv5 and trained a model which can detect some of the warehoue objects.
My model is trained on 6 classes namely hat, vest, goggles, glove, shoes of the employee on the warehouse. We can use this for detecting whether the employees are wearing their safety equipments while working.

The one thing I like very much about the YOLO model is that, after training it on our dataset we can inference the results in any form of source like image, video, live web cam feed.

Down here I have provided the drive link for downloading the annotated images dataset. And the config file data.yaml
